# Sentiment Analysis of Airline Tweets: From Data Exploration to Production Implementation

This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data related to major airline companies, gathered from February 2015. The main objectives and processes of the project are:

+ **Data Exploration:** Analyzing the sentiment distribution across airlines, identifying common reasons for negative sentiments for each airline, and exploring the relationship between sentiment confidence and retweet count.
+ **Sentiment Analysis Model:** Building a machine learning model to predict tweet sentiments, involving data preprocessing, model refinement, and evaluation.
+ **Path to Production:** Theoretical discussion on deploying the model in a production environment, covering ongoing training, data quality assurance, performance monitoring, and integration into web services.

## Part 1 - Data Visualisation

### Overview
In this part, we focus on visualizing and analyzing the sentiment distribution within a dataset of tweets related to various airline companies. The following key areas are explored:

- Distribution of Sentiment Across Airlines
- Analysis of Negative Tweet Reasons by Airline
- Relationship Between Sentiment Confidence and Retweet Count

Each analysis is supported by appropriate visualizations and insights derived from the data.

### Distribution of Sentiment Across Airlines

The visualization shows the distribution of sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) across different airlines.
1) Negative Sentiment Prevalence: Negative sentiments still dominate for most airlines, indicating a trend where customers are more likely to express dissatisfaction on social platforms.
2) Variation Among Airlines: There's a noticeable variation in the volume and distribution of sentiments across different airlines, suggesting differing levels of customer satisfaction or public perception.
3) Airline-Specific Trends: Specific airlines show different patterns in sentiment distribution, which could be indicative of their service quality, customer experience, or public relations effectiveness.
